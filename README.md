Game prototype for SNHUperior Games

# User Experience Brief

#	User interface: 
This game is meant to be played on a PC or game console where the Player can use a keyboard/mouse or keypad to control movements (forward, back, left, right, jump, kneel). The game will be played as a 3rd person shooter, in an open “sand box” world. There will be additional attack options available: sword/Axe attack, bow and arrow, and hand melee.
There will also be a health meter which should affected by enemy attacks as well as damage from falls and exhaustion from lack of food.

There will also be the option on 1-2 occasions, for the Player to shoot or manipulate light. This is a “special attack” that is available per a charging meter that increases throughout gameplay, measuring the Player-character’s “confidence. When the character has developed enough confidence, and is under high levels of stress, there is access to this “special attack” that can destroy almost all enemies. 

Health and confidence meters will always be visible, as well as an option to check articles and weapons. Multiple weapons can be carries, but on one in the hand. The menu and map will be accessible on a separate screen, accessible using the select or start button (or escape keys).

# Gameplay: Articulate the approach to the functionality that will define this game. 
Game play will be fast paced with a sense of constant urgency. The game is player will start as a young boy, with little fighting skill, and develop into a skilful and intelligent warrior. Weapons will be found as the Player progresses, so the initial challenges will involve running, hiding and stealth. By mid-game, the player will get the chance to use and fight with normal weapons.

My intention is to create a constant feeling of “being chased” with hidden characters who seem normal but are enemy recruits. If the player lingers too long, there should be enemies that spawn to attack him along his journey.
Horse riding should be involved throughout the game. And realism, is an important element. Exhaustion of the players and horses should be a variable that requires rest along the journey.
Points/Scoring: no points will be tabulated, but game will measure health, confidence and “the void”. The void is a place where the player has heightened concentration and can aim and attack with more accuracy.
Money: money can be earned along the way, for playing in bars/taverns or working for villagers. The money can be used to rest in an INN, or to purchase food, weapons, or supplies.

# Immersion: Articulate the approach to which elements of this game will contribute to user immersion (and how).
The game was first inspired by a behind the game like Book chapters. The first level will open up with a young boy in his village doing chores and interacting with his father. In the night there is an attack on the village, which leads to the title screen and beginning of the first quest.

The setting takes place with rustic medieval villages old growth forests, haunted lost cities and mountain caves. Sound and art will help create the setting to bring the Player into the storyline, the way one’s imagination does with a good book. Atmospheric sounds and unexpected surprise attacks should give the Player the sensation that there is a dark force following him along his journey.  The game should use both reflexive attention and executive attention to help keep the Player immersed in the storyline and gameplay.

The first chapter will be a journey from the Player’s home village to the haunted castle. Second Chapter will be an escape from the castle to a docked trading ship. Third chapter will be journey from a port village to the Main Kingdom, 4th Chapter will be through an underground “time-portal”  and the Fifth, a Warrior village and a journey to the Oracle. The final chapter is the Boss Battle.
